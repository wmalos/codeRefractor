# codeRefractor

For this task I made the webpage for this company more accessible while cleaning up the code in both html and css where I felt there could be improvements.

Steps:

    Edited the title of the webpage
    Entered alt text for the images on the page
    Combined elements with the same properties in order to simplify the code
    Made sure all links were working
    Made adjustments so that the page was more accessible on smaller screens
    To do that I adjusted image sizes and background color in order to be able to read the text
